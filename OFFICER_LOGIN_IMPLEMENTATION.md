# Officer Login Implementation - Sai Finance Web

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of officer login functionality in the Sai Finance Web application, enabling collection officers and other staff members to access their dedicated dashboards.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Dual Login System**
- **User Login**: Regular customers can log in using `users/login` endpoint
- **Officer Login**: Staff members can log in using `officers/login` endpoint
- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically tries user login first, then officer login if user login fails
- **Role-Based Routing**: Different dashboards based on officer type

### 2. **AuthContext Enhancements**
- **File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- **New State Variables**:
  - `userType`: 'user' or 'officer'
  - `userRole`: Officer type ('admin', 'manager', 'accounter', 'collection_officer')
- **Enhanced Login Function**: Handles both user and officer authentication
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores user type and role in localStorage

### 3. **Collection Officer Dashboard**
- **File**: `src/pages/Dashboard/officer/CollectionOfficerDashboard.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Today's performance metrics
  - Overall performance statistics
  - Recent collections display
  - Real-time data fetching from officer collection endpoint
  - Responsive design with animations

### 4. **Officer Navigation**
- **File**: `src/pages/Dashboard/officer/OfficerNavbar.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Role-based navigation menu
  - Officer profile display
  - Logout functionality
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Role badge display

### 5. **Officer Layout**
- **File**: `src/pages/Dashboard/officer/OfficerLayout.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Wrapper component for officer routes
  - Integrated navigation and content areas
  - Route management for officer-specific pages

### 6. **Enhanced Routing**
- **File**: `src/routes/Mainroute.jsx`
- **New Routes**:
  - `/officer/*` - Collection officer routes
  - `/admin/*` - Administrator routes
  - `/manager/*` - Manager routes
  - `/accounter/*` - Accounter routes
- **Smart Redirects**: Automatically redirects based on user type

## Login Flow

### 1. **Authentication Process**
```
User enters credentials → Try user login → If fails, try officer login → Route based on type
```

### 2. **Role-Based Routing**
- **Collection Officer** → `/officer/dashboard`
- **Admin** → `/admin/dashboard`
- **Manager** → `/manager/dashboard`
- **Accounter** → `/accounter/dashboard`
- **Regular User** → `/dash/home`

### 3. **Data Storage**
- **Token**: Stored in localStorage
- **User Type**: 'user' or 'officer'
- **User Role**: Officer type for role-based access
- **Account Type**: Stored in IndexedDB for offline access

## API Integration

### 1. **Officer Login Endpoint**
- **URL**: `POST /officers/login`

  ```json
  {
    "phone_number": "string",
    "password": "string"

    }
  }
  ```

### 2. **Officer Collection Data Endpoint**
- **URL**: `GET /officers/{officerId}/collection-data`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "result": {
