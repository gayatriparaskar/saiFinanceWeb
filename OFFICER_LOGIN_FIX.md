# Officer Login Fix - Access Token Issue

## Problem Identified
The officer login was failing with the error: "Login successful but no access token received"

## Root Cause
The officer login response structure was different from the user login response:

### User Login Response Structure:
```json
{
  "accessToken": "jwt_token",
  "user": { ... }
}
```

### Officer Login Response Structure:
```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "result": {
    "accessToken": "jwt_token",
    "officer_type": "collection_officer",
    "name": "Officer Name",
    "_id": "officer_id",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Solution Implemented
Updated the `AuthContext.jsx` to handle both response structures correctly:

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
if (response.data && response.data.accessToken) {
  const accessToken = response.data.accessToken;
  const userData = response.data.result || response.data.user || response.data;
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Check for access token in different response structures
let accessToken = null;
let userData = null;

if (loginType === 'officer') {
  // Officer login response structure: { success: true, result: { accessToken, ...officerData } }
  accessToken = response.data.result?.accessToken;
  userData = response.data.result;
} else {
  // User login response structure: { accessToken, user: {...} }
  accessToken = response.data.accessToken;
  userData = response.data.result || response.data.user || response.data;
}

if (response.data && accessToken) {
```

## Key Changes
1. **Separate handling** for officer vs user login responses
2. **Correct token extraction** from `response.data.result.accessToken` for officers
3. **Proper user data extraction** from the correct response structure
4. **Maintained backward compatibility** for user login

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ Officer login now correctly extracts access token
- ✅ User login continues to work as before
- ✅ Role-based routing functions properly

## Result
Officer login now works correctly and collection officers can successfully:
- Log in with their credentials
- Get redirected to their dashboard
- View their collection data
- Access officer-specific features

The fix ensures that both user and officer login work seamlessly with their respective response structures.
